# Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs without leaving their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Tailwind doesn’t offer predefined component styles but instead provides a set of utility classes that let you style elements directly within the HTML structure, keeping CSS concise and manageable.

## Key Features

- **Utility-First**: Design with a low-level set of classes that give you full control over your layout and style without relying on specific components.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind has built-in responsive modifiers that make it easy to create adaptive designs.
- **Customizable**: Tailwind is highly customizable through a configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`), allowing you to define colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints, and more.
- **PurgeCSS for Optimization**: Automatically removes unused CSS in production builds, making stylesheets lightweight.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Easily toggle between light and dark themes with Tailwind's dark mode utility classes.

## Installation

You can install Tailwind CSS via npm:

```bash
# Install Tailwind CSS via npm
npm install -D tailwindcss

# Generate Tailwind configuration files
npx tailwindcss init
```

## Add Tailwind’s directives to your main CSS file (e.g., src/index.css):

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Basic Usage
With Tailwind, you build your design by applying utility classes directly to HTML elements:
```
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  Hello, Tailwind CSS!
</div>
```
